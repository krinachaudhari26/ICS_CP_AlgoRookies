This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C. The game supports both single-player (against the computer) and multiplayer modes. Below are instructions on how to execute the code.
Environment Setup
Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system. If not, you can install one such as GCC.
Dependencies
There are no external dependencies for this code. It uses standard C libraries such as stdio.h, stdbool.h, and math.h.
Execution Steps
1.	Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.	Navigate to the directory where you have saved the file.
3.	Compile the code using a C compiler.
4.	Follow the on-screen prompts to select the game mode, enter player names and characters (if applicable), and make moves.
Game Modes

•	Single Player (0): Play against the computer. You will be prompted to enter your character and the character for the computer.

•	Multiplayer (1): Play against another human player. Each player will take turns making moves.

Notes
